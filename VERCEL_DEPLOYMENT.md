# Vercel Deployment Guide with Security

## ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING

Your EmailJS credentials are currently hardcoded in `index.html`. While the **Public Key** is meant to be public, exposing it in your code is still a security risk because:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Anyone can see your Public Key and spam your email
2. **Account Abuse**: Malicious users could send unlimited emails through your account
3. **Cost**: EmailJS has free tier limits - abuse could exceed them

## ✅ SECURE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Portfolio ready for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/new
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Click "Deploy"
4. Your site will be live at `https://your-username.vercel.app`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended)

Even though EmailJS Public Key is meant to be public, you can still protect it:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. Add these variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_o0382pf
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_kdldom7
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=9aDFHA4whx9CYlrG4
   ```

4. Update `index.html` to use them:
   ```javascript
   const EMAILJS_CONFIG = {
       serviceID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID || 'service_o0382pf',
       templateID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID || 'template_kdldom7',
       publicKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY || '9aDFHA4whx9CYlrG4'
   };
   ```

## 🛡️ ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES

### 1. EmailJS Restrictions
Go to https://www.emailjs.com/dashboard and:
- Set **Domain Whitelist** to only your Vercel domain
- Set **Rate Limit** to prevent abuse
- Enable **CAPTCHA** verification (if available)

### 2. Vercel Security
1. Enable "Vercel Analytics" to monitor requests
2. Set up "Deployment Protection" if needed
3. Use "Preview Deployments" for testing

### 3. Monitor Email Usage
- Check EmailJS dashboard regularly
- Set up email alerts for unusual activity
- Review sent emails log
